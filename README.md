Python files are in this branch I used Boto3 library which is the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create, configure, and manage AWS services. In main.py there is a code for listing Vpcs in my region and for different regions as well. In S3.py there is code to use S3 using this library. In services.py there is code to list all aws services.AWS services.py has the script creates an EC2 instance from a custom AMI ID and keeps the instance alive for 3 minutes (can be modified as per needs).
Before creating the EC2 instance, it creates a VPC of CIDR Block - 10.0.0.0/16 & a subnet of 10.0.0.0/24 (Can be modified as per needs).
It also creates an Internet Gateway and a route table for the Gateway and required route to open the traffic for VPC. It also associates
the route table for Gateway with the created subnet. After terminating the created instances, it deallocates all the allocated resources
automatically. The script is crude in the sense, it assumes no exceptions and only serves the required functionalities. The parameters are
all hardcoded for easy use. It assumes AWS access credentials, AWS CLI configurations and all the required dependencies already present. In script.py there is script to tag different AWS Resources.
